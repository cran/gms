#' Model lock/unlock
#'
#' Lock the model to coordinate multiple processes accessing the model.
#' This is necessary if you change files within the model and have to
#' avoid that another process reads from your half-written changes in
#' the mean time.
#' model_lock creates an exclusive lock on the given file and returns
#' a lock id. When the lock id is handed to model_unlock the lock is
#' dropped again, and another process can take the lock. The lock
#' is also dropped when the lock id goes out of scope and is garbage
#' collected in R or when the R process terminates or crashes. However,
#' it is good practice to explicitly call model_unlock when you don't
#' need the lock anymore.
#' If you want to check for informational purposes if the model is
#' currently locked by another process, you can use the is_model_locked()
#' function.
#' Note however that you should never use is_model_locked() to coordinate
#' access to the model folder. The return value of is_model_locked() is
#' only a snapshot at the time when the function is run.
#' Note additionally that is_model_locked() checks if the model is
#' locked by another process. If you currently hold the lock of the model
#' yourself, it will return FALSE.
